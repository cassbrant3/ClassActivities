# This is a top-level header.
## This is a second-level header.
### This is an even smaller header.

###### This is a 6th-level header, and is quite small.
Here is some normal text. A paragraph, even!

*This text is in italics.*

**This text is in bold.**

***This text is in both.***

~~This text is rendered with strikethrough.~~

E.G: Sometimes you want to embed some *stylized text* right into **your paragraph.** Pretty cool, right!
